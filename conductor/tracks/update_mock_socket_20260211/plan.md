# Implementation Plan - Update mqtt_mock_socket for Enhanced Realism and UI Features

## Phase 1: Core Logic Enhancements (Data Realism) [checkpoint: 909d00c]
- [x] Task: Implement random amplitude and duration scaling logic. `[ ]`
- [x] Task: Add simulation for early low-value arrival at cycle ends. `[ ]`
- [x] Task: Implement jitter and non-compliant polling rate reporting. `[ ]`
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1' (Protocol in workflow.md) [x]

## Phase 2: Measure Feature Fixes [checkpoint: 1792749]
- [x] Task: Investigate and fix the empty measurement overlay bug when highlighting. `[ ]`
- [x] Task: Implement the enhanced data calculations (Peak, Avg, Duration, Wh, Variance, Timestamps). [x]
- [x] Task: Update the UI to display the new measurement fields. `[ ]`
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2' (Protocol in workflow.md) [x]

## Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements (Log & Queue)
- [ ] Task: Implement the smart sticky auto-scroll logic for the log view. `[ ]`
- [ ] Task: Design and implement the "Imported Cycle Source Data" view (List, Registry). `[ ]`
- [ ] Task: Implement the queue management logic (Next Up, Timeline, Selection/Skip). `[ ]`
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3' (Protocol in workflow.md) `[ ]`

## Phase 4: Verification & Polishing
- [ ] Task: Run integration tests to ensure existing features remain intact. `[ ]`
- [ ] Task: Perform manual verification of all new realism artifacts and UI features. `[ ]`
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4' (Protocol in workflow.md) `[ ]`
